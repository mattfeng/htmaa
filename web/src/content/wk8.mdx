# week 8: input devices

## parts this week
- [Doppler radar](https://www.amazon.com/RCWL-0516-Detection-Microwave-Raspberry-Detector/dp/B07GCHY9K6)

## build log
- for this week, i wanted to detect motion using a doppler radar
- the wiring for the breakout board was simple enough that designing a PCB for it wasn't hard; i just needed to add a three pin header
