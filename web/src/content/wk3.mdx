# week 3: 3d printing and scanning

## design rules: characterizing the 3d printer(s)
- two kinds of 3d printers
    - Sindoh
    - Prusa
- supports
    - overhang
    - clearance
- unsupported
    - angle
    - overhang
    - bridging
- wall thickness
- dimensions

- anisotropy
- surface finish
- infill
- angles

## 3d printing: something that can't be made subtractively

- removing the support material was rather unnerving but surprisingly easy (as long as you take your time)

## 3d scanning: a very finicky process
