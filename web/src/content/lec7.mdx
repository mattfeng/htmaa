## assignment

### group assignment
- review the safety data sheets for each of your molding and casting materials,
- make and compare test casts with each of them

### individual assignment
- design a mold around the stock and tooling that you'll be using,
- mill it (rough cut + (at least) three-axis finish cut)
- use it to cast parts
