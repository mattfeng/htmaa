# lec 7: molding and casting

## molding

### types
- injection
    - vocab
        - sprue
        - runner
        - gate
        - vent
        - parting line
        - flashing
- insert, overmolding
- vacuum
- blow
    - inflate into a mold
    - e.g. plastic bottles
- rototional
- vacuum, pressure assisted
- die, investment casting
- flexible, soft, short-run production
- mold
    - parts
        - separate parts can create complex molds (e.g. tessaract)
    - registration
        - completely fit one mold into the other mold

### vendors
- Smooth-On
- Reynolds Advanced Materials
- Dick Blick
- West Marine
- USG
- Chockfast
- Aremco
- Protolabs

### materials
- _casting materials do not change volume_ (that is their purpose)
- low-temp wax
    - melts at slightly above room temperature
- machineable wax (mold)
- rigid foam (mol)
    - gesso, epoxy, shrink wrap, hot air
- wood
- alginate gel
- urethane (casting)
    - rubber
        - useful for soft parts
    - plastic
    - colorants
- clear rubber epoxy (cast)
- silicone (cast)
    - OOMOO
        - very inert
- PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane)
- latex (don't really use)
    - only a surface cure
    - only useful if you want to put a mold cover on another object
- thermoplastic, thermoset polymers
- calcium sulfate
    - desicant, coagulant, plaster, gypsum, drywall
    - Drystone
- Portland cement
    - calcium silicate, aluminum/iron oxide, calcium sulfate
    - Hydro-Stone
- metal
    - Cerrotru
        - alloy that can be used to make coins
    - aluminum clay sand glass
- ceramic
- food
    - SORTA-Clear series

### additives
- fibers (tension, compression, composites)
    - generally, cast materials are better in compression than tension
    - fibers improve tension
- fillers
    - density
    - conductivity
    - flexibility

### processing
- workspace
- testing
    - casting materials have a lifetime where they can ruin molds
    - test a casting material with a test mold
- mixing
    - weight
    - volume
    - consistency
        - drystone, hydrostone can use consistency to gauge mixing (should be like heavy cream, yogurt)
    - striations
        - mix until striations go away
        - takes 5x longer than expected
- pouring
    - starting
    - filling
        - _tilting_ the mold can be helpful for a smooth top
    - vent location
- bubbles
    - stirring, pouring, vibrating, painting, vacuum, pressure
    - time
        - 5 to 10 minutes for deair-ing
- curing
    - polymerization
    - cross-linking
    - hydration
    - endothermic
    - exothermic
    - work time is usually about **20 minutes**
    - materials
        - OOMOO
            - slightly adding heat accelerates curing
        - urethane
            - needs heat
- demolding
    - **hot life.** time between curing and demolding
        - demolding usually takes **1 hour**
    - draft angle
    - release agents
        - hydrostone and OOMOO don't need release agents
        - dilute dish soap, vaseline, talc, ...
    - deformation
- storage
- shelf life

### safety
- warnings
- SDS
- ventilation
- protection
    - gloves
- disposal
    - mix the unmixed materials together
    - do some test casts

### machining
- _fixture with bead of hot glue_
- surface finish
- rough, finish, stepover
- tool types
    - flat end
    - ball end
    - extra long, long neck, tapered
    - micro
- cut depth, shank, collet, collision, slope
    - design around diameter and depth of cut, otherwise the mold will be un-machineable

### software
- ShopBot VCarve Pro
- Fusion 360 Moldflow
- Solidworks Plastics
- mods community rough finish

## assignment

### group assignment
- review the safety data sheets for each of your molding and casting materials,
- make and compare test casts with each of them

### individual assignment
- design a mold around the stock and tooling that you'll be using,
- mill it (rough cut + (at least) three-axis finish cut)
- use it to cast parts
