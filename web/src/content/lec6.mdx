# lec 6: embedded programming

## memory
- SRAM: fast read/write, can't modify (need to retrieve into register first)

## peripherals
- ports
- A/D (analog to digital)
- comparator (compare voltages)
- D/A (digital to analog)
- timer/counter/PWM
- USART (serial communcation)
- USB

## families
- we will use AVR and ARM
- AVR
    - DB family has analog signal processing (_amplifiers_)
- ARM
    - ARM chips are manufactured [Microchip](https://www.microchip.com/)
    - 32 bits, _USB uses 5V; need a 3.3V regulator_
    - uC has multiple clock zones
- [Xtensa (the architecture)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensilica)
    - integrated RF and networking
    - ESP8366 (8 bit)
    - ESP32 (32 bit)

## packages (how the chip connects to the board)
- [QFN (quad-flat-no-leads)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_no-leads_package)

## programming
- AVR: programmed with UPDI
    - Tx and Rx linked with resistor
    - lets the UPDI pin have two voltages for in and out
- ARM: programmed with JTAG
    - subset called SWD
    - use a program called EDBG to load SWD
    - FreeDAP is the program that converts a SAMD11C board into one that can program JTAG for other boards

## host communication
- RS232: original spec for serial communication
