# all electronics

- pull down resistors are used to hook the input to ground, but protect against shorts when the switch is flipped on

## two kinds of mosfets
1. standard, **power mosfets**
2. logic level mosfets

- mosfets don't require a constant current like BJT (NPN transistors) do
- mosfets have a gate resistor to avoid shorting (pulling too much current from the microcontroller) when the gate is first turned on


## N channel mosfets
- drain (D) conducts to the source (S) when the gate (G) is fully charged
