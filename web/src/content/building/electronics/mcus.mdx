# microcontrollers (MCUs)

- key feature of mcus is that they have **peripherals**, smaller, special function circuits that the MCU can use to interact with the physical world: setting voltages on pins (i.e. send power to other electronics), read data (voltages) from sensors, etc.
    - &ldquo;the mcu is our bridge between _computing on data_ and _computing on physical stuff_.&rdquo;

- we generally load programs into _flash_, which is why the process is also called _flashing_ the mcu.

- **toolchain.** any sequence of tools used to turn code into a piece of operating firmware

- bootloaders detect if there is a new program to flash at startup, and flash them if so; otherwise they run the current program in memory

## special function registers (SFRs)
- the pins that we use to interact with the world? those are called **special function registers**
- examples of SFRs
    - SERCOMs (serial communication)
    - timers
    - analog/digital convertors (ADCs)
    - digital/analog convertors (DACs)
