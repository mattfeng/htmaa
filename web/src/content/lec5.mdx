# lecture 5: computer-controlled machining

## machines
- roland
- shaper
    - precision machining
    - useful for modifying already machined pieces
- shopbot (~$15k)
    - **workhorse for this week**
- onsrud
    - available in the _arch_ section
    - much stiffer than the shopbot; more sturdy
    - **stiffness** = tolerance, machining forces, machining speed
- tormach
- haas
- hurco
    - available in the _cba_ shop
    - 1 ft work volume
    - 5-axis cnc
    - high speed machining of hard metals with complex geometry

## vendors
- mcmaster-carr
    - metals, plastic 
- us plastics
    - plastics
- admiral metals
    - metals
- home depot
    - has everything
    - unpredictable; have to design around what home depot has
- contractors (lumberyards; often have scrap that can be used)
    - boulter plywood
    - steritt lumber
    - beacon sales

## job shops
- Plethora
- Proto Labs
- Star Rapid
- Yubo Precision
- DSH
- Cycle Start
- Fast Forward Composites
- Xometry

## tooling
- drills vs mills
    - drill only goes down
    - endmills can go either down or sideways
- router, V bits
    - routers have bits that _only go sideways_
- flutes
    - how many flutes?
- coatings
- center-cutting
- up/down cut
    - up cutting tools: pulls up on the top surface
    - down cutting tool: clean surface, but no where for chips to go
    - trick: _down cut_ shallow first, then come back and _up cut_
- flat/ball end
    - flat end for main cutting
    - ball end used for finish cutting
    - flat end actually can be used for finish cutting too

## speeds and feeds
- [machinery's handbook](https://books.industrialpress.com/machinery-handbook/)
- chip load: ~ 0.001-0.010"
    - feed rate (inches per minute) / (RPM x number of flutes) 
- **cut depth.** how much depth does the mill advance each round?
    - rule of thumb: use the _tool diameter_
- **step-over.** the overlap when cutting adjacent paths
    - rule of thumb: use _tool diameter / 2_

## lubricants
- helps with heat transfer

## abrasive machining, grinding
- endmills are made via _grinding_
- featureless drill + abrasive slurry = milling glass
    - **NC (numerical control) griding**

## fixturing
- vises
    - NC grinding vises have much tighter tolerances
- clamps
    - bar clamps
    - can lead to bowing of board
    - only works when on edge of board
- screws
    - hold stock with screws, and ensure mill path avoids the screws
- nails
- vacuum
    - vacuum can hold the stock in place
    - get plugged up; need to be maintained
- wedges
- weights
    - for waterjet cutters because there are no lateral forces
- glue
    - machining wax
- tape
    - machining wax
- encapsulation
    - used for 5-axis machines on complex sheets

## sacrificial layers, squaring
- cut out a square part to **check that the axes are perpendicular**
- three layers (bottom to top)
    - surfaced underlay + sacrificial + workpiece (stock)

## dust collection

## flexures, living hinges, kerfing, steam bending, wacky wood
- **flexure.** series of small hinges
- **kerfing.** not milling all the way through the stock

## joinery, reciprocal frame, tensegrity, Maxwell criterion
- **reciprocal frame.** structures made from joints only
- **Maxwell's criterion.** number of [joint constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_constraints) need to match the degree of freedom
    - e.g. bookcase needs X shape tendons, otherwise bookcase can sheer

## toolpaths
- kerf, offset, runout
    - 1/8" or 1/4" mill
    - handling kerf; _need to shift paths by tool size_
    - **runout.** the wobble in the tool makes the tool diameter larger than expected
- conventional, climb
    - climb = cleaner cuts
    - climb = outward force 
    - conventional = less force on machine
    - conventional = leaves rougher surface behind
- rough/finish cuts
    - rough = conventional
    - finish = climb
    - _rough cuts are done in layers_
    - finish cuts get the smooth finish
- high-speed, dry, ramping, adaptive clearing, swarf, rest, trochoidal
    - mill cuts more effectively at a diagonal
- one-sided, two-sided, registration
- 2 (layers), 2.5 (steps), 3 (molds), 4, 3+2, 5 axis
- tool length compensation
- cut depth, clearance, collisions
    - shank, collet can all collide with stock; _need to keep in mind_
- T-bones, dog-bones
    - radius of endmill will not have rectangular joints
    - need to make **T-bones** or **dog-bones** to get rectangular cuts
- **nesting.** placing the parts to fit well into the stock
- tabs, onion skinning
    - need **tabs** or **onion skins** to prevent the nested parts from moving
- lead-in, lead-out
- test cuts, cutting air
    - X/Y flipped
    - origin wrong
    - Z wrong
    - **cutting air.** run your job away from the stock (Z axis away from the table)
    - **test cuts.** tiny patch, small cut
        - cut depth, feed rate
- simulation
- prototyping
    - _make the project in cardboard first_

- individual assignment
    - make (design+mill+assemble) something big (~meter-scale)
    - extra credit: include curved surfaces
