## build log

- [look here for notes that i took while building the project (e.g. measurements, reference pics, etc.)](./notes)

### basic knowledge

- **batteries**
  - LiPo batteries typically listed as _1S_, _2S_, _3S_, etc. each `S` represents a battery cell, which corresponds to more voltage:
    - <C chem="\mathrm{1\ S} = \pu{3.7V}" />
    - <C chem="\mathrm{2\ S} = 2 \times \pu{3.7V} = \pu{7.4V}" />
  - LiPo batteries also have a **discharge rating (&ldquo;C&rdquo; rating).** the discharge rating describes the _maximum number of amps_ that can be safely pushed from the battery

### cad
- [**1.5 mL Eppendorf tube**](https://www.amazon.com/Globe-Scientific-111558-Polypropylene-Microcentrifuge/dp/B00577ZQH8/)

### rotor and dimensions

### board

- I had to mill the board over 4 times to complete the final project: what a time...
  - the first board I made was very tightly packed (even following the `fab.dru` design rules) and resulted in a board with weakly adhered traces. likely, i also weakened the traces 
  - the second board
  - the third board was correct
  - the (second try) of the third board
  - the fourth board worked &mdash; annoyingly, i also ripped a trace off when i was trying to clean up the board of stray traces to prevent shorts, which made me have to remill the board

- **pinout**
  - ESC
    - PA14 <RA /> ESC PWM signal
  - A1324 (Hall Effect)
    - PA02 <RA /> Hall effect output voltage

### ESC motor

- **calibrating the ESC motor.** probably the most annoying yet also satisfying moments was getting the ESC motor calibrated and running.
  - the first issue was sending the correct signal to the motor. at first i was thinking that my calibration protocol wasn't working
  - calibration didn't work because pin 5 wasn't working
  - power on with high pulses, wait until beeps
  - turn off
  - switch to low pulses
  - turn on
  - wait for beeps
  - turn off
  - turn on
  - set to speed less than high
  - for some reason, 

i was also wondering where the power (5V) came from in the [ESC demo board](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/output_devices/ESC/hello.ESC.44.png) ([components](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/output_devices/ESC/hello.ESC.44.jpg)); i think it's not actually a used connection and that voltage comes from the external source that powers the motor.
