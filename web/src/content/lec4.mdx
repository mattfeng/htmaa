# lecture 4: electronics production

## components
- capacitor
    - unpolarized
        - two plates
    - polarized
        - electrochemical
    - typical capacitance: ÂµF
- crystals and resonators
    - voltage -> mechanical displacement -> back to voltage
    - used to tell time
- diode
    - `anode -> cathode`
    - 0.6 V diode drop
- schottky diode
    - polarized
    - line = cathode = direction current flows
- zener diode
- MOSFET
    - $R_{DS}$ resistance between drain and source

## designing circuits (EDA)
- ATSAMD11C
    - [hello.D11C.echo.1.png](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/embedded_programming/D11C/hello.D11C.echo.1.png): needs adaptor from commercial programmer
        - picture to circuit using EDA
    - [hello.D11C.echo.png](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/embedded_programming/D11C/hello.D11C.echo.png): standard
        - 10 pin is standard for commericial programmers, even though not all ten pins are used
- **footprints**: need libraries of these
- use **Octopart** to find different **packages**
    - what is a package (?)
- design rules
    - how skinny traces can be
    - how close traces can be (manufacture)
    - how close traces can be (signal interference/crosstalk)
    - how much power can go before overheats

## characterization
- power supply noise
